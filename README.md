# SDF3: SDF For Free

This is a mirror repository of the SDF3 software by the Electronic Systems Group at the Eindhoven University of Technology, also available at [www.es.ele.tue.nl/sdf3](www.es.ele.tue.nl/sdf3), with the addition of a Dockerfile and a few scripts to allow easy use on any Docker-compatible platforms other than Linux.
